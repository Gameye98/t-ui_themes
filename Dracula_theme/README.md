❗️ 🦇  🎨   DRACULA THEME   🎨  🦇 ❗️<br>

📌  If you want to view the above applications as icons, as shown in the screenshot, rename alias_dracula.txt to alias.txt - making a backup of your previously created aliases!<br>
N.B. it is likely that you will have to change some names of some applications in alias.txt (for example for gallery app, because I use a MIUI OS)<br>

📌  REMEMBER TO ADD:<br>
in `weather_location`: your weather information (city ID or longitude / latitude);<br>
in `username`: your name;<br>
in `device_name` your device;<br>

📌  To change the word at the top: edit HEADER file with whatever you want<br>

📌 There is an alias in my file: if you run "icons" you will see all icons in the included font.
