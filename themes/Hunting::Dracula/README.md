## Hunting::Dracula

**Ladies and Gentlemen I have the pleasure of introducing you to: Hunting::Dracula**

A modified version of the **[Dracula V2 theme](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/tree/main/themes/Dracula_V2)** that integrates the gorgeous **[DeadRabbit's script](https://github.com/deadrabbit404)** but in a modified version.

I added:
- cpu temperature
- battery status (charging/discharging Ampere)
- battery temperature
- top process
- other small changes 

**However, this script needs root to display some options**
.... anyway if you do not have root you can use the original script, present in the script folder, changing the path in expert.xml file

üìç Wallpaper included


I also remind you that to manage tui-e themes you can use my script: **[TTM](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/tree/main/theme-manager)**
