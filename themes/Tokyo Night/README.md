This theme has two variants: **Pure** and **Extra** version.
The "Pure" version only uses t-ui expert while the "Extra" version requires the installation of another application.

### 🔍✏️ INFO:

**WEATHER**: the weather (via custom_command) should automatically recognize your location, otherwise open the expert.xml file and in the penultimate line add your city, for example:
<custom_command value = "curl -s w ttr.in/Florence?0T" />

**ICONS**: if you don't want to see the (alias) application icons, open my alias.txt file and delete the first 13 lines.

**GROUPS**: This theme takes advantage of the very useful function of application groups. 
I created 7 groups: Tools; Social; Miui; Games; Root; Media; Google.
To change the names, open the apps.xml file and change the initial uppercase name : <TOOLS apps =
The file also contains apps that I have already included in some categories.
You can add as many applications as you want with the command:
apps -addtogp GROUPname APPname
to create a group, type: 
apps -mkgp groupNAME

**TO-DO**: if you use my alias, you can use notes with the todo and showtodo commands, try!







## ㊗️ TOKYO NIGHT - "extra" version 1.0

Here is the "extra" version of Tokyo Night, which requires the installation of an additional application that I provide in the zip package [(plus a theme created by me) please consider purchasing the attached app, to support the developer (it's not me) ].

📐Before continuing, I would like to clarify that, if you have a display different than mine (6,55", 2400x1080), you will have to manually align the additional elements.

🔍Difference between "pure" and "extra" version:

1) Weather: the "extra" version shows the forecast for the next 5 days, in addition to the current situation

2) Download speed: a small widget shows the download speed

3) CPU speed: speed and percentage of CPU usage

4) Battery temperature: another small widget shows the real time temperature of the battery

5) More info: here you can read some features of this theme, including an introduction video, which also applies to this "extra" version (weather function excluded): https://t.me/t_ui_themes_v2/1098
