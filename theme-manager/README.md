<br>


## üìå Features

Its main functions are:

* Install a theme chosen from those available
* show the list of available themes
* show theme previews, via GitHub
* backup your current theme
* restore the previous backup
* update the script and the list of available themes

## üìå Prerequisites:
* [T-UI Expert](https://github.com/v1nc/T-UI-Expert/releases/download/v0.4.4e/de.reckendrees.systems.tui.expert_fdroid_v.0.4.4e.apk)
* Termux/TEL or Busybox (the script needs to access curl or wget to execute some commands)


## üìå How to install ttm

**Option 1: automatic way**
* Download [install_ttm.zip](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/raw/main/theme-manager/install_ttm1.zip) and extract it into your internal storage ( /storage/emulated/0 )
* On t-ui, change directory to the extracted folder if you are in a location other than the internal memory
* Then type `sh install_ttm.sh` and wait for installation to finish
* When setup is done, `restart` or `refresh` t-ui
* NOTE: If you can't install ttm via t-ui because you don't have root or because the script doesn't find curl or wget, follow next step: manual way.

**Option 2: manual way**
* Download [ttm script](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/raw/main/theme-manager/ttm.zip) and extract it into your internal storage ( /storage/emulated/0 ).
* On t-ui Expert type:
* `alias -file`
* add these 2 alias at the bottom of the list
* `ttm=sh /storage/emulated/0/ttm %`
* `ttm -p=search -u https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes`
* Save file and `restart` or `refresh` t-ui.


## üìå How to use ttm

**You can use the script in 3 different ways:<br>**
1Ô∏è‚É£. Through T-UI Expert with root (easier method)<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£. Through T-UI Expert without root (difficult method)<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£. Through Termux/TEL or another Terminal emulator (medium-easy method)<br>
<br>

### CASE 1Ô∏è‚É£ -- Through T-UI Expert with root

If you have a rooted device then export Termux/TEL user bin folder into the $PATH. From tuie type:<br>
`export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets && su -c tsu`


**Important:** *This needs to be done for every session like if TUI Expert app re-launchs or the phone is rebooted etc.. so add an alias called <b>init</b>, type:*<br>
`alias -file` <br>

*Copy and paste this line at the end of file:*<br>
`init=export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets && su -c tsu` <br>

*Save and refresh t-ui Expert.*<br>
***When you reboot your device or restart t-uie, just type `init`.*** <br>

>**NOTE**: *If you are using Termux instead of TEL, it is likely that you need to install the `tsu` package, from Termux then type:
`pkg install tsu` <br>
>This step is not mandatory, you can use ttm script even without tsu package but you will need to change the "init" alias as follows:
`init=export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets` <br> 
>and remember, whenever you want to use the ttm 'install' and/or 'update' commands, or the termux (integration) commands from T-UI, you will first have to type `su` and then `init` commands.*
      
Now you can use all commands of Termux bin folder from tuie. <br>
Test it: type `curl --help`<br>

Now type `ttm -h` to view all <b>ttm</b> available commands.<br>


P.S. With root, another possibility is to install the Busybox static binaries through the Magisk module called: **Busybox for Android NDK**

<br>

### CASE 2Ô∏è‚É£ -- Through T-UI Expert without root



To run ttm script in T-UI Expert without root, you need to be able to run the curl/wget command without the need for T-UI Expert's Termux/TEL integration, that is, without the use of the command: `termux curl`/`termux wget`<br>
If you are unable to do this, I recommend using Termux (or TEL) - check the next point.
<br>

### CASE 3Ô∏è‚É£ -- Through Termux/TEL or another Terminal emulator

#### With TERMUX):<br>
* Download [install_ttm.zip](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/raw/main/theme-manager/install_ttm1.zip) and extract it into your internal storage ( /storage/emulated/0 ).
* Now install F-droid app: https://f-droid.org/F-Droid.apk
* Open F-Droid, search and install Termux
* Check that Termux has memory access permission activated. In t-ui(e) type: `apps -st Termux` and check memory permission.
* Now run Termux and install wget, type `pkg install wget`
* Update Termux packages, type `pkg update` <br>
* Note: if during the package update, messages like *"what would you like to do about it?"* appear, type "N" and press enter (N means "keep your currently-installed file version")
* Once the packages have been updated, type `cd /storage/emulated/0`  - or type the directory where you unzipped the install_ttm.zip file
* Now run the `bash install_ttm.sh` command to install <b>ttm</b>
* 

[..... W.I.P. .... ]

#### With TEL):
* Download [install_ttm.zip](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/raw/main/theme-manager/install_ttm1.zip) and extract it into your internal storage ( /storage/emulated/0 ).
* edit your ~/.zhsrc file with (for example) nano, type:`nano ~/.zhsrc` and add the following lines:<br>
* `alias ttm='bash /storage/emulated/0/ttm'`
* `alias ttm-p='am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes'`
* Save .zhsrc file and exit: CTRL + S and CTRL + X
* Now reload .zhsrc, type: `source ~/.zshrc`<br>

To check themes previews via GitHub, type: `ttm-p`<br>
Type `ttm -h` to view all the other commands.<br>
