#didyouknow

Nr. 01

📢📢Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the new column: #didyouknow?

With this column I will post messages containing little tips about T-UI configuration, lesser known options or useful commands.  To view all the messages sent, simply use the search button and type: #didyouknow

📍This is the first message, if you like the idea I will continue.  I also remind you that ANYONE can participate and post his guide, his advice, just remember to add the tag #didyouknow at the beginning of your message.


---- QUICK ALIAS ----

You can define a no-named alias by adding this line (in alias.txt):
=aliasValue

This is pretty useful when you don't want to waste time for an emergency, or something similar.

For example:
=call 112
=call mom
or
=t-ui -folder
etc...

To start this alias just press "enter", or "space" and "enter".
Enjoy
