### ---- QUICK ALIAS ----

**You can define a no-named alias by adding this line (in alias.txt):**
`=aliasValue`

This is pretty useful when you don't want to waste time for an emergency, something similar or commands you use very often.

For example:<br>
`=call 112`<br>
`=call mom`<br>
or<br>
`=t-ui -folder`<br>
etc...

**To start this alias just press "enter", or "space" and "enter"!!!!**<br>
<i>You don't need to type any commands or text, that's the advantage of this special alias!</i><br>
Enjoy
